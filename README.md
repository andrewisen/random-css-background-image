# Random CSS Background Image

Get a random CSS background image for your pseudo element.

```css
div::after {
    background-image: url("random-image.jpg");
}
```

## Introduction

It can be hard to update the **pseudo element** with plain JavaScript.
This code snippet is a simple PHP server that serves a random image.

I use this code snippet in some of my side project.
This is **not** the most elegant way to serve a random image, but it works for me. Enjoy!
